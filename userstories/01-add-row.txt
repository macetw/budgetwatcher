As a <Budget user>
  I would like to <Add a row to my budget>
  So that I can <forecast by budget into the future>


Given <a known bill in the future>
  When I <put due dates in and the amount of the bill and click "Add">
  Then I <would expect the new data to appear on the table>

Given <a blank description input (debit)>
  When I <click Add>
  Then I <would expect the data to be rejected and the Add button is disabled>

Given <a zero amount>
  When I <click Add>
  Then I <would expect the data to be rejected and the Add button is disabled>

Given <a known income in the future (profit)>
  When I <put due dates in and the amount of the bill and click "Add">
  Then I <would expect the new data to appear on the table>
