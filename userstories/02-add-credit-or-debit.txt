As a <Budget user>
  I want to <have independent "Add Credit" and "Add Debit" buttons>
  So that <I don't have to worry about a negative sign in my spin box>


Given a <negative amount value>
  when I <try to enter the negative value>
  then it <prevents me from entering it>

Given a <running of the application>
  When I <run it>
  Then <the Add Credit and Add Debit buttons appear independently, Credit has green text and Debit has red text>

Given a <set of credit values>
  When I <click Add Credit>
  Then <the amounts appear as positive and in green on the table>
  
Given a <set of debug values>
  When I <click Add Debit>
  Then <the amounts appear as negative and in red on the table>
